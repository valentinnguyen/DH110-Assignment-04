## Purpose of UX Storytelling

The purpose of UX storytelling is to understand the user's motivations and intentions. It is have an open mind and willingness to change your perspective on how websites work based on how users view and navigate interfaces. Through research and collecting data, we can use our resources to create a better and more accessible product for users no matter how comfortable they are with using technology. UX storytelling also helps designers and developers to create a narrative in their product to better reach their goals and serve the target user by empathizing with the users' stories.  


## Design Features

1. Filters - make filters accessible and customizable so that users can make control and organize the content and profiles that show up on their screen.

2. Search Function - have a clear and explicity search function feature within the website that suggests searches the user may want to look up.

## User Scenarios and Journey Maps

### 1.

Maya Edwards works as an Adults Services Librarian at her local library in her hometown, Walnut Creek, California. However, due to the pandemic, she has temporarily stopped working to respect safety measures implemented by the city and has been staying at home ever since. After some time, Maya realized that she has never felt more alone than ever and craves social interaction even though she is naturally introverted. She is particularly interested in getting to know people from younger generations. However, since she is not the social type, she lacks in that ability and wants to find a way to practice and get better at having conversations with other people.

Maya opens her computer and goes to YouTube, since she has heard from word of mouth that it is a great website to search for tutorials. She types in the "how to have a conversation" in the search bar at the top of the website and hits the enter key on her keyboard. Suddenly, her screen is full of a bunch of videos, and Maya gets overwhelmed by the number of content as well as words that pop up. She then sees the option to apply a filter to her search, and wants to organize her search so that she can see the videos with the most views fire. Maya chooses the 'View Count' filter because it's the only filter with the word 'view' in it. The page refreshes, and the video with the most amount of views based on her search shows up at the very top of her screen, called ["7 Ways to Make a Conversation With Anyone"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4Zu5ZZAG7I&t=181s). She clicks on the video and watches the whole 15 minutes of it, taking notes while she watches. When she finished, she now feels confident to socialize and has the courage to go out and speak with people.

### 2.

Charlie is a retired real estate agent who now stays at home because of the pandemic (just like everyone else). He doesn't go out often because of how immunocompromised he is, and spends a lot of his time cleaning his house. Sometimes he watches something on his television and has heard a lot of uprisings and social actions happening on social media, and becomes curious about it. However, he has always felt like social media was only made for younger people, and not people like himself who are older. Charlie also feels like the Internet is too complicated to use, and gets impatient and overwhelmed by all the buttons and features on a website. He is also curious about how ythe younger generation uses the Internet to call for action on social issues, and would like to meet and talk with them to learn more.

Because Charlie has heard of FaceBook from his children, he decides to open his computer and go on FaceBook to see if he can try to make a social media profile. FaceBook's interface easily allows him to make a profile, but once he gets to FaceBook's main page, he is overwhlemed with the number of features and icons that appear on the page. Charlie was about to give up, but then he sees the wide white bar at the top of the page that says "Search for someone you know". He clicks on the search bag and types the name of an old coworker, Nicole Davis. Her profile pops up and he recognizes her profile picture immediately. He then notices an "Add Friend" button next to her name and clicks on it. Having felt like he is getting the gist of the interface, he then notices Nicole's friends list and finds a whole bunch of his other coworkers. Before he knew it, he's chatting with a few of his old friends and even got to meet some mutual friends along the way, even a few that happened to be younger and more well-versed in technology. Charlie feels immensely satisfied that not only was he able to make his own social media profile, but he also made some new friends as well and got to learn more about the culture of the younger people around him.
