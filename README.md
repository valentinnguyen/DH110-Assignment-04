## Purpose of UX Storytelling

The purpose of UX storytelling is to understand the user's motivations and intentions. It is have an open mind and willingness to change your perspective on how websites work based on how users view and navigate interfaces. Through research and collecting data, we can use our resources to create a better and more accessible product for users no matter how comfortable they are with using technology. UX storytelling also helps designers and developers to create a narrative in their product to better reach their goals and serve the target user by empathizing with the users' stories.  


## Design Features

1. Help Function and Q&A Feature - clearly include a section that presents a number of common questions and solutions that users can view when they are having trouble navigating the app.

2. Search Function - have a clear and explicity search function feature within the website that suggests searches the user may want to look up.

## User Scenarios and Journey Maps

### 1.

Maya Edwards works as an Adults Services Librarian at her local library in her hometown, Walnut Creek, California. However, due to the pandemic, she has temporarily stopped working to respect safety measures implemented by the city and has been staying at home ever since. After some time, Maya realized that she has never felt more alone than ever and craves social interaction even though she is naturally introverted. She is particularly interested in getting to know people from younger generations. However, since she is not the social type, she lacks in that ability and wants to find a way to practice and get better at having conversations with other people.

Maya has heard from her coworkers that they have been using a social media app that allowed them to meet new people online safely and anonymously. She goes on the app and doesn't know where to start, as her screen is full of information. She pauses for a while because she is overwhelmed. Suddenly, a little chat box pops up on the lower right hand corner of a robot asking "Do you need help with anything?" Maya is relieved and types in the chat box that she doesn't know how to find people to meet and talk to. The robot then automates a message linking her to another page on the website that shows her a step-by-step video tutorial on how to navigate the website. Maya is excited and watches the tutorial, taking notes as she goes. When the video finishes playing, she now feels confident in her ability to navigate the website and realizes that it wasn't so bad after all. She follows what the tutorial said, which was to customize her profile with her traits and interests and hobbies, and watches as the website automatically generates people for her to meet based on her interverted and bookwormy personality. She ends up meeting a few people who were younger that had the same interests as her, and has had amazing conversations with them. She feels successful at fulfilling her needs and is confident in using the website to meet more people.

### 2.

Charlie is a retired real estate agent who now stays at home because of the pandemic (just like everyone else). He doesn't go out often because of how immunocompromised he is, and spends a lot of his time cleaning his house. Sometimes he watches something on his television and has heard a lot of uprisings and social actions happening on social media, and becomes curious about it. However, he has always felt like social media was only made for younger people, and not people like himself who are older. Charlie also feels like the Internet is too complicated to use, and gets impatient and overwhelmed by all the buttons and features on a website. He is also curious about how ythe younger generation uses the Internet to call for action on social issues, and would like to meet and talk with them to learn more.

Charlie has heard of a social media website that allows him to meet new people based on his personality and interests from his coworkers, and decides go on the website to see if he can try to make a social media profile. He finds the interface easy to use when he was making his profile. However, when he got to the site's main page, he is overwhlemed with the number of features and icons that appear on the page. Charlie was about to give up, but then he sees the wide white bar at the top of the page that says "Search for someone you know". He clicks on the search bar and starts typing the name of an old coworker, Nicole Davis. As he types, a dropdown menu of multiple people under the name 'Nicole Davis' appeared, with their profile pictures next to their names. He sees the Nicole Davis that he knows and recognizes her profile picture immediately. He then notices an "Add Friend" button next to her name and clicks on it. Having felt like he is getting the gist of the interface, he then notices Nicole's friends list and finds a whole bunch of his other coworkers. Before he knew it, he's chatting with a few of his old friends and even got to meet some mutual friends along the way, even a few that happened to be younger and more well-versed in technology. Charlie feels immensely satisfied that not only was he able to make his own social media profile, but he also made some new friends as well and got to learn more about the culture of the younger people around him.
